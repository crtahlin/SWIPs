## Simple Summary
<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the SWIP.-->
This SWIP outlines how Swarm decentralized storage can be utilized as a trusted third-party solution for storing and managing data provenance. It highlights potential use cases, technical considerations, and business benefits for leveraging Swarm in provenance-related applications.

## Abstract
<!--A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.-->
Provenance ensures accountability and integrity by tracking the origins and transformations of data. This SWIP explores how Swarm’s decentralized storage can serve as a foundation for provenance systems by leveraging its immutability, trustless design, and scalability. The document discusses compatibility with existing standards (e.g., W3C PROV, Data & Trust Alliance spec), technical requirements for uploading and accessing provenance data, and considerations for privacy and encryption. It also addresses potential extensions, such as integrating AI agents for data validation and interpretation.

## Motivation
<!--The motivation is critical for SWIPs that want to change the Swarm protocol. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the SWIP solves. SWIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->
Data provenance is critical for ethical AI development, regulatory compliance, and ensuring trust in data-driven systems. Current solutions often rely on centralized storage or public blockchains, which have limitations in scalability, privacy, or cost. Swarm offers a unique alternative as a decentralized storage network that combines immutability with flexibility. This SWIP aims to demonstrate how Swarm can address key challenges in provenance systems while aligning with emerging standards and market needs.

## Specification
<!--The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for the current Swarm platform and future client implementations.-->
The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for the current Swarm platform and future client implementations.

## Rationale
<!--The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->
Swarm’s decentralized nature makes it ideal for acting as a trusted third party in provenance systems. Unlike public blockchains, it supports larger data sizes without compromising privacy when encryption is used. While standards like W3C PROV are comprehensive, they may be too complex for some use cases; simpler alternatives like the Data & Trust Alliance spec are more practical for initial implementations. This approach allows flexibility while ensuring compatibility with existing standards.

## Backwards Compatibility
<!--All SWIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The SWIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. SWIP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.-->
This proposal does not introduce changes to Swarm’s core functionality or protocols. It leverages existing capabilities such as immutable storage and reference hashes, ensuring full compatibility with current implementations.


## Test Cases
<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for SWIPs that are affecting changes to data and message formats. Other SWIPs can choose to include links to test cases if applicable.-->

## Implementation
<!--The implementations must be completed before any SWIP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the SWIP is accepted. While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.-->
A prototype toolkit will be developed as part of the fellowship deliverables. This toolkit will include features for uploading, retrieving, validating, and extending storage of provenance data on Swarm.
